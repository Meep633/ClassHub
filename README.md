# ClassHub

ClassHub is a centralized classroom application made by Siyan Zuhayer (@Meep633), Parker Dinsdale (@pdinsdale), and Zoha Ahmed (@Zoha-ahmed) for Intro to ITWS in spring of 2023. It's an app made to combine different classroom functionalities used in many apps such as LMS, Google Classroom, Discord, and WebEx Teams. ClassHub was created with RPI students in mind.  
To run the application, you will need to host it on a server (jQuery code won't work otherwise due to SOP). The easiest way to do so would be to open it using the Microsoft Live Preview extension on VSCode (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server).
